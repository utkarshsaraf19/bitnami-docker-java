# What is Java?

> Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

```console
$ docker run -it --name java bitnami/java
```

## Docker Compose

```console
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-java/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

## Deprecation Note (2020-08-18)

The formatting convention for `prod` tags has been changed:

* `BRANCH-debian-10-prod` is now tagged as `BRANCH-prod-debian-10`
* `VERSION-debian-10-rX-prod` is now tagged as `VERSION-prod-debian-10-rX`
* `latest-prod` is now deprecated

# What are `prod` tagged containers for?

Containers tagged `prod` are production containers based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb). They contain the minimal dependencies required by an application to work.

They don't include development dependencies, so they are commonly used in multi-stage builds as the target image. Application code and dependencies should be copied from a different container.

The resultant containers only contain the necessary pieces of software to run the application. Therefore, they are smaller and safer.

Learn how to use multi-stage builds to build your production application container in the [example](/example) directory

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Java Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/java).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/java:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/java/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/java:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/java 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-java.git#master:17/debian-10'
```

# Configuration

## Running your Java jar or war

The default work directory for the Java image is `/app`. You can mount a folder from your host here that includes your Java jar or war, and run it normally using the `java` command.

```console
$ docker run -it --name java -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/java:latest \
  java -jar package.jar
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
java:
  image: bitnami/java:latest
  command: "java -jar package.jar"
  volumes:
    - .:/app
```

# Maintenance

## Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Java, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

### Step 1: Get the updated image

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/java:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to `bitnami/java:latest`.

### Step 2: Remove the currently running container

```console
$ docker rm -v java
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose rm -v java
```

### Step 3: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```console
$ docker run --name java bitnami/java:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker-compose up java
```

# Notable Changes

## 1.8.252-debian-10-r0, 11.0.7-debian-10-r7, and 15.0.1-debian-10-r20

- Java distribution has been migrated from AdoptOpenJDK to OpenJDK Liberica. As part of VMware, we have an agreement with Bell Software to distribute the Liberica distribution of OpenJDK. That way, we can provide support & the latest versions and security releases for Java.

# Branch Deprecation Notice

Java's branch 16 is no longer maintained by upstream and is now internally tagged as to be deprecated. This branch will no longer be released in our catalog a month after this notice is published, but already released container images will still persist in the registries. Valid to be removed starting on: 11-08-2021
